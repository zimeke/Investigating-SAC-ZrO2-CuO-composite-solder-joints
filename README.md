# Investigating SAC-(ZrO2/CuO) composite solder joints

During the preparation of my thesis, I collected and summarized scientific publications and articles found on professional portals in order to qualify the characteristics of composite solder. I briefly summarised several research studies on composite solder. I have explored the potential drawbacks of the solder materials used in the industry and how they are trying to overcome these drawbacks. I have described the effects and consequences of Pb extraction. I have also analysed in detail the challenges of soldering and the solutions offered. In addition, I have reviewed several studies that have dealt with the qualification of composite soldering materials and summarised their results. Shear strength and reliability tests were carried out on individual test panels and the results were summarised. For my own tests I used ZrO2 and CuO particles and investigated the effect of these particles on the soldered bond of conventional SAC. I described the equipment used in the experiment and the method of preparing the panels used for the experiment. Finally, I briefly proposed a further study to gain a more detailed picture of the effect of ZrO2 and CuO.
